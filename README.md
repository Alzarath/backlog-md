# Backlog M.D.

Backlog M.D. is an application used to assist someone in tracking their backlogs while storing them in the human-readable text markup format, [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Specifically, it's meant to be read by an extended markdown variant that supports tables, such as [Github-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
